    				<h4>Despite often being thought of as a million-dollar industry, the truth is that as a whole, college athletics are not very profitable. Most Division 1 programs in the United States do not even turn a profit anymore. So why is this the case? Simple: they're paying a whole lot more than they used to.</h4>

					<h3>The Modern College Arms Race</h3>
					<p>I will preface this by saying: no, college sports aren't a total sham. If this report focused only on Football and Men's Basketball, it would describe college athletics as what many people think it is: a thriving industry. Those two sports make millions for the larger D1 programs and, at the very least, turn a profit for the majority of smaller ones. But when everything else is factored into the euqation, those incredible gains often vanish just paying for the costs of running an entire athletic department.</p>
					<p>According to <a rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/finances-intercollegiate-athletics-database" target="_blank">NCAA.org</a>, only schools within the D1 FBS (Football Bowl Subdivison) have turned a profit any year between 2010 and 2019. Of those schools, almost all are a part of the "Power 5" Conferences: the conferences that have the largest media rights deals. Were it not for the massive television contracts (which make up 90% of revenue in sports other than football), it's entirely possible that the few who are financially successful now would also be in the red. Over this 10 year span, there have only been three instances where a college outside of the Power 5 managed to turn a profit in athletics. As for those in the FCS (Football Championship Subdivision) and those without a football program: well, they're out of luck. Every single one has lost money each year for a decade.</p>
					<p>So what must those Football and Basketball programs do to stay profitable? Win at any cost. Only by investing millions into top-tier training facilities, stadiums/arenas, and coaching/recruiting does any program stand a chance at making money. It's a huge gamble, but one that has become commonplace in these two sports. So where did this necessity to spend wildly begin?</p>

					<h3>The Impacts of Title IX</h3>
					<p>When Title IX was passed in 1972, it mandated that moving forward, colleges and universities would need to provide equal opportunities for men and women to compete in sports. Eventually, this was clarified to mean that the number of male vs female students with athletic scholarships needed to be proportionate to the number of male vs female students overall. That decision on its own was intended to prevent discrimination against females wishing to pursue college athletics and grant them a fair chance of doing so. But it also created the environment we see today. </p>
					<p>SU Sport Management Prof. Michael Veley said that an unintended consequence of Title IX is the staggering rise in expenses to field women's teams. "Title IX and the expansion of womenâ€™s athletics has dramatically increased business costs," he  said. In addition to creating new facilities designated for women's sports, schools also have to maintain those facilities, pay travel expenses, set aside scholarship money, and potentially cut existing programs. For example, Syracuse cut the Men's Wrestling and Gymnastics programs when it created varsity Women's Soccer, Softball, and Lacrosse teams in the late 1990s. The issue here is that women's sports simply are not profitable. Very few people attend their games, they don't receive lucrative TV contracts, and general media coverage is lackluster. As a result, schools have to divert untold millions away from other portions of their athletics departments.  For example, Ohio State, despite having a football program that competes for the national title and a stadium that seats over 100,000 people, still ended up losing money.</p>

					<h3>How this trend can change</h3>
					<p>The most important thing to do is for colleges and television networks to give women's sports more media coverage. Women's sports only consist of about 5% of ESPN's coverage, and on its flagship program, <i>SportsCenter</i>, it's even worse - only a meager 2.2%. Simply put, no one is going to follow or attend an event that they don't even know about. The rise of NIL (name, image, likeness) has allowed college athletes to market themselves to an extent - the problem is that the NCAA does not have clear regulations on the matter, thus hindering potential exposure.</p>
					<p>Prof. Veley thinks that the only way for college sports to remain sustainable is for a new governming body to form and replace the NCAA. Doing so would involve the top 64 programs splitting off from the rest of the pack, abandoning the notoriuosly inconsistent management of the organization behind. Don't think of this as a pipe dream: there's already significant evidence that this could happen within the decade.</p>
					<p> Texas and Oklahoma, the two best-run athletic departments in the Big 12, are leaving for the SEC in 2024. After that happens, Veley predicts that the conference will collapse, and the teams in it will flee to the other four Power 5 conferences. These "Super 4" would survive by mandating revenue sharing - the same tactic that allows the NFL to keep teams in obscure locations like Green Bay and Jacksonville. Several prominent figures, such as West Virginia MBB Head Coach Bob Huggins, have publicly spoken in favor of such a change.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>College Athletics are reaching a breaking point, and the decisions made in the coming years will decide to what extent sports fans can continue to enjoy watching their favorite team(s) compete. Exponentially-rising costs threaten to divide the "haves" and the "have-nots," and unfortunately, it seems the only clear way forward is to embrace the current climate and realize that starting fresh is better than trying to shuffle the deck chairs on this sinking ship any longer.</p>
